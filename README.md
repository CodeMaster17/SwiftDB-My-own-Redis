<p align="center">
SwiftDB is a in-memory key-value store that is inspired by Redis. It is written in Go and is designed to be a learning project for me to understand how Redis works under the hood. It uses the same commands and PORT as Redis, so you can use the same Redis clients to interact with SwiftDB.
